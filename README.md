# SasGPT: because we couldn't think of anything better

Congrats, you've stumbled upon SasGPT, a repository that's just as boring as its name! Inside, you'll find GPT.py, a Python module that can help you generate text, complete sentences and suggest words and phrases.

## Installation: seriously, did you not Google this?

To install GPT.py, you can use pip. I mean, come on, did you really need me to tell you that? 🙄

```
pip install gpt
```

Of course, GPT.py relies on the OpenAI GPT API, so you'll need to sign up for some keys before you can use the model. But let's be real, you didn't need me to tell you that either, did you? 😉

## Usage: because coding is child's play

Using GPT.py is pretty simple, even for someone who's coding skills are questionable at best. Here's an example of generating text using the GPT model:

```python
import gpt

prompt = 'Hello, what’s up?'
length = 20
gpt_output = gpt.generate(prompt, length)
print(gpt_output)
```

See, even you can do it! 👏

## Disclaimer: because we don't want to get sued

I hope you're not planning on using this code for anything important, because we sure aren't. SasGPT is offered as-is, without any warranty or support. So if it crashes your computer, sets your office on fire or opens up a portal to another dimension, don't come crying to us. 😂

## Attribution: because we want the credit

SasGPT is a project of Sasquatch Inc. Yes, we're serious. And yes, we're proud of it... kind of. This repository is released under the MIT license, and that's all you really need to know about that.
